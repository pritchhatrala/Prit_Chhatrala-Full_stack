4. What are the main input/output operations in C++? Provide examples.
Ans. :-
The two instances cout in C++ and cin in C++ of iostream class are used very often for printing outputs and taking inputs respectively. These two are the most basic methods of taking input and printing output in C++. To use cin and cout in C++ one must include the header file iostream in the program



#include <iostream>
Using namespace std;

int main() {
    int age = 25;
    cout << "Hello, World!" << endl; 
    cout << "I am " << age << " years old." << endl;
    return 0;
}
