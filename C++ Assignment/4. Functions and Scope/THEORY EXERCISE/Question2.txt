2. What is the scope of variables in C++? Differentiate between local and global scope.
Ans. :-
The scope of a variable in C++ refers to the region of the program where the variable can be accessed. C++ has two main types of variable scopes: local scope and global scope. The scope determines the lifetime and visibility of a variable in the program.

---Types of Scope---

1. Local Scope
Variables declared within a function or a block (enclosed by {}) have a local scope.

Accessible only within the block where they are declared.
Created when the block is entered and destroyed when the block is exited.

example:

void example() {
    int localVar = 10;  // Local variable
    cout << "Local Variable: " << localVar << endl;
}


2. Global Scope
Variables declared outside all functions have global scope.

Accessible throughout the program, including all functions (unless shadowed by a local variable).
Remain in memory for the program's lifetime.

example:

int globalVar = 20;  // Global variable

void example() {
    cout << "Global Variable: " << globalVar << endl;
}
