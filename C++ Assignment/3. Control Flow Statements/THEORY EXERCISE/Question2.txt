2. What is the difference between for, while, and do-while loops in C++?
Ans. :-
Loops are used in C++ to execute a block of code multiple times. The key differences between for, while, and do-while loops lie in their structure, use cases, and how they handle iteration.

1. for Loop
--Purpose: Used when the number of iterations is known in advance.
--Structure: Combines initialization, condition, and update in a single line.

for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    cout << i << " ";
}
Output: 0 1 2 3 4

2. while Loop
--Purpose: Used when the number of iterations is not known, and the condition is checked before each iteration.
--Structure: Only the condition is specified; initialization and update occur outside the loop.

int i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    cout << i << " ";
    i++;
}
Output: 0 1 2 3 4


3. do-while Loop
--Purpose: Used when the code needs to be executed at least once, regardless of the condition.
--Structure: Condition is checked after the code block executes.

int i = 0;
do {
    cout << i << " ";
    i++;
} while (i < 5);
Output: 0 1 2 3 4
