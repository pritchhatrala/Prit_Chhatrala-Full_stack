3. How are break and continue statements used in loops? Provide examples.
Ans. :-
The break and continue statements are control flow tools used in loops to alter their normal execution.

1. break Statement
The break statement is used to exit a loop prematurely, regardless of the loop's condition. It is often used when a specific condition is met, and continuing the loop is unnecessary.

Example:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
        if (i == 5) {
            break;  // Exit the loop when i equals 5
        }
        cout << i << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}

2. continue Statement
The continue statement skips the rest of the code inside the current loop iteration and proceeds to the next iteration. It is useful for skipping specific cases without terminating the entire loop.

Example:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
        if (i == 5) {
            continue;  // Skip the iteration when i equals 5
        }
        cout << i << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}
