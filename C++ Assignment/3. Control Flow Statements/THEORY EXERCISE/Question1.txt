1. What are conditional statements in C++? Explain the if-else and switch statements.
Ans. :-
Conditional statements are used in C++ to perform different actions based on certain conditions. They allow the program to make decisions during execution by evaluating expressions that result in either true or false.

1. if-else Statement
--Executes code based on whether a condition is true or false.
--Can handle ranges and complex conditions.

int num = 5;
if (num > 0) {
    cout << "Positive number";
} else {
    cout << "Negative number";
}

2. switch Statement
--Used for multiple fixed conditions, such as matching values.
--Works with integral or enumerated types.

int day = 3;
switch (day) {
    case 1:
        cout << "Monday";
        break;
    case 3:
        cout << "Wednesday";
        break;
    default:
        cout << "Invalid day";
}
