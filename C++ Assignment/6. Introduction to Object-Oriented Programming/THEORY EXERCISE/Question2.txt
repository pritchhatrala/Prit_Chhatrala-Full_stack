2. What are classes and objects C++? Provide an example.
Ans. :-
In C++, classes and objects are fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

---1. Class:
-A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties (data) and behaviors (functions) that the objects created from the class will have.

--A class can contain:
Data members (attributes): Variables that represent the state of the object.
Member functions (methods): Functions that define the behavior of the object, allowing interaction with its data.


---2. Object:
An object is an instance of a class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated. Memory is allocated when an object is created. Each object has its own copies of the class's data members, but they share the same methods.

---Example---

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;


class Car {
public:
    
    string brand;
    string model;
    int year;

    void displayDetails() {
        cout << "Brand: " << brand << endl;
        cout << "Model: " << model << endl;
        cout << "Year: " << year << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Car car1;
    Car car2;

    car1.brand = "Toyota";
    car1.model = "Corolla";
    car1.year = 2020;

    car2.brand = "Honda";
    car2.model = "Civic";
    car2.year = 2021;

    cout << "Car 1 details:" << endl;
    car1.displayDetails();
    cout << endl;

    cout << "Car 2 details:" << endl;
    car2.displayDetails();

    return 0;
}
