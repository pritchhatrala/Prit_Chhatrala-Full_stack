3. What is inheritance in C++? Explain with an example.
Ans. :-
-Inheritance is one of the key concepts in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It allows a class (derived class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (base class). This promotes code reuse and helps to create a hierarchical relationship between classes.

---Types of Inheritance in C++:---
--1. Single Inheritance: A derived class inherits from a single base class.
--2. Multiple Inheritance: A derived class inherits from more than one base class.
--3. Multilevel Inheritance: A class derives from another derived class, forming a chain.
--4. Hierarchical Inheritance: Multiple derived classes inherit from a single base class.
--5. Hybrid Inheritance: A combination of more than one type of inheritance.

---example---
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Animal {
public:
    string name;

    void speak() {
        cout << name << " makes a sound!" << endl;
    }
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void bark() {
        cout << name << " barks!" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Dog dog1;
    dog1.name = "Buddy";   
    dog1.speak();          
    dog1.bark();           

    return 0;
}
