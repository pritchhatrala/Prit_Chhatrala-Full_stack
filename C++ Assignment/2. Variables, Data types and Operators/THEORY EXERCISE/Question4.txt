4. Explain the purpose and use of constants and literals in C++.
Ans. :-
--Purpose of Constants and Literals:--

Constants are fixed values that do not change during the program's execution. They enhance code readability, maintainability, and prevent accidental changes to critical values.
Literals are the actual values assigned to constants or variables in the code (e.g., numbers, characters, strings, etc.).

--Use of Constants and Literals:--

Improve Code Readability: Using meaningful names for constants like const int MAX_USERS = 100; makes the purpose of the value clear.
Maintain Consistency: Changing a constant in one place updates it throughout the program.
Avoid Magic Numbers: Using named constants instead of hard-coded numbers makes code more understandable.
Prevent Accidental Modification: Constants ensure that critical values, such as PI or MAX_USERS, remain unaltered.
