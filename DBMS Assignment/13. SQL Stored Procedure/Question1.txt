1. What is a stored procedure in SQL, and how does it differ from a standard SQL query?
Ans:-
---Stored Procedure in SQL:
--A stored procedure is a precompiled collection of SQL statements and optional control-flow logic (e.g., loops, conditionals) that can be stored and executed on the database server. It is reusable and often used to perform repetitive tasks or complex operations.

---Example:
Stored Procedure:
CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeeDetails (IN dept_id INT)
BEGIN
    SELECT employee_name, salary
    FROM employees
    WHERE department_id = dept_id;
END;


Standard SQL Query:
SELECT employee_name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE department_id = 1;
