2. How do PRIMARY KEY and FOREIGN KEY constraints differ?
Ans:-
1. Definition
PRIMARY KEY: A constraint used to uniquely identify each record in a table.
FOREIGN KEY: A constraint used to establish a relationship between two tables by linking a column in one table to the PRIMARY KEY in another table.

2. Purpose:
PRIMARY KEY: Ensures that no two rows have the same value in the specified column(s) and that the value cannot be NULL.
FOREIGN KEY: Enforces referential integrity by ensuring that the value in the referencing table matches a value in the referenced table.

3. Number of Constraints:
PRIMARY KEY: A table can have only one PRIMARY KEY, but it can consist of multiple columns (composite key).
FOREIGN KEY: A table can have multiple FOREIGN KEYS referencing different tables.

4. Example:
--PRIMARY KEY:
CREATE TABLE students (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    student_name VARCHAR(100)
);


--FOREIGN KEY:
CREATE TABLE enrollments (
    enrollment_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    student_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES students(student_id)
);

5. Data Integrity:
PRIMARY KEY: Ensures uniqueness and non-null values within the table.
FOREIGN KEY: Ensures that the referenced value exists in the parent table.
