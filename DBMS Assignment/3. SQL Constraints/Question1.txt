Ans:-

---What are Constraints in SQL:
-->Constraints in SQL are rules applied to columns in a table to enforce data integrity, accuracy, and reliability. They ensure that the data entered into a table meets specific criteria and prevents invalid data entry.

---Types of SQL Constraints:

1. NOT NULL:
--Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value.

2. UNIQUE:
--Ensures that all values in a column are distinct.

3. PRIMARY KEY:
--Combines NOT NULL and UNIQUE. Identifies each record uniquely in a table.

4. FOREIGN KEY:
--Establishes a relationship between two tables by linking a column to the primary key of another table.

5. CHECK:
--Ensures that all values in a column satisfy a specific condition.

6. DEFAULT:
--Sets a default value for a column if no value is provided.

7. INDEX:
--Improves query performance by creating an index on a column.
