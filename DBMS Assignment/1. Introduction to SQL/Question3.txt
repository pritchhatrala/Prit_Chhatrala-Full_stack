1. Data Querying:
->SQL allows users to retrieve specific data using commands like SELECT with filters, conditions, and sorting.

2. Data Manipulation:
->SQL helps add, update, and delete data using commands like INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.

3. Data Definition:
->SQL defines and modifies database structures such as tables, indexes, and schemas with commands like CREATE, ALTER, and DROP.

4. Data Control:
->SQL manages user permissions and controls access to data using commands like GRANT and REVOKE.

5. Data Integrity:
->SQL enforces rules such as primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints to maintain data consistency.

6. Automation:
->SQL supports stored procedures, triggers, and views for automating tasks and optimizing workflows.
