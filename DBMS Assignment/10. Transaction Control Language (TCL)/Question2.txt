2. Explain how transactions are managed in SQL databases.
Ans:-

Definition of Transactions:
A transaction in SQL is a sequence of one or more SQL statements that are executed as a single unit of work. A transaction ensures that the database remains consistent even in the event of errors or system failures.

---Key Properties of Transactions (ACID):
--Atomicity: Ensures that all operations within a transaction are completed successfully. If any operation fails, the entire transaction is rolled back.
--Consistency: Ensures that the database remains in a valid state before and after the transaction.
--Isolation: Ensures that multiple transactions can run concurrently without interfering with each other.
--Durability: Ensures that committed changes are saved permanently, even in the event of a system crash.

Example:
START TRANSACTION;

INSERT INTO teachers (teacher_id, teacher_name) VALUES (14, 'prit');

UPDATE teachers SET teacher_name = 'jaydeep Sir' WHERE teacher_id = 1;

COMMIT;

ROLLBACK
