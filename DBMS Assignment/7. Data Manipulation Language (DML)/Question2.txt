2. What is the importance of the WHERE clause in UPDATE and DELETE operations?
Ans:-

----Importance of the WHERE Clause in UPDATE and DELETE Operations----

1. WHERE Clause in the UPDATE Command
The WHERE clause in an UPDATE command is crucial because it specifies which rows should be updated. Without the WHERE clause, the command would update all rows in the table, which is typically not the intended behavior.

Example:
UPDATE students
SET age = 16;


--This would update the age of every student in the students table to 16.
With the WHERE clause:

Example:
UPDATE students
SET age = 16
WHERE student_id = 1;

2. WHERE Clause in the DELETE Command
The WHERE clause in a DELETE command is equally important because it defines which rows should be deleted. Without the WHERE clause, the command would delete all rows in the table.

Example:
Without the WHERE clause:
DELETE FROM students;

---this command deletes every row from the students table, effectively removing all student records.
With the WHERE clause:

Example:
DELETE FROM students
WHERE student_id = 1;
