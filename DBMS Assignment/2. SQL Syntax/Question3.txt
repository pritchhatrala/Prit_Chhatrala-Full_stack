3. Explain the role of clauses in SQL statements.
Ans:-
---Common Clauses and Their Roles---

1. SELECT Clause:
--Specifies the columns to retrieve from a table.
--Example: SELECT student_name, age FROM students;

2. FROM Clause:
--Identifies the table or tables from which to retrieve data.
--Example: SELECT * FROM students;

3. WHERE Clause:
--Filters rows based on specified conditions.
--Example: SELECT * FROM students WHERE age > 15;

4. GROUP BY Clause:
--Groups rows with the same values in specified columns for aggregation.
--Example: SELECT class, COUNT(*) FROM students GROUP BY class;

5. HAVING Clause:
--Filters groups created by the GROUP BY clause based on a condition.
--Example: SELECT class, COUNT(*) FROM students GROUP BY class HAVING COUNT(*) > 2;

6. ORDER BY Clause:
--Sorts the query result by specified columns in ascending or descending order.
--Example: SELECT * FROM students ORDER BY age DESC;

7. LIMIT Clause (or TOP in some databases):
--Restricts the number of rows returned.
--Example: SELECT * FROM students LIMIT 5;
