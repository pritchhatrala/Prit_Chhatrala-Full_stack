2. How are joins used to combine data from multiple tables?
Ans:-
1. Identify Common Columns:
--Tables must have at least one column in common (called a "key").
--These columns act as a bridge between the tables.

2.Join Conditions:
--Use the ON clause to specify how rows from one table relate to rows in the other table (e.g., table1.column = table2.column).

3. Combine Rows:
--SQL evaluates each row from the first table against rows in the second table.
--Based on the type of join, SQL decides which rows to include in the result.
