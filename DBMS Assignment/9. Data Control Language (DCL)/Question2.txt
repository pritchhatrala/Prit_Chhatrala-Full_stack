2. How do you manage privileges using these commands?
Ans:-

1.Granting Privileges:
The GRANT command allows database administrators to assign specific privileges to users or roles, controlling their access to database objects such as tables, views, or procedures.

---Steps to Grant Privileges:---
--Identify the privileges to assign (e.g., SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE).
--Specify the database object (e.g., table name) for which the privileges are granted.
--Use the TO clause to assign privileges to a specific user or role.

Example:
GRANT SELECT, INSERT
ON students
TO john;

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Revoking Privileges:
The REVOKE command is used to withdraw privileges that were previously granted. This is essential for restricting access when users no longer require it or for security purposes.

---Steps to Revoke Privileges:---
--Identify the privileges to remove.
--Specify the database object from which the privileges should be revoked.
--Use the FROM clause to specify the user or role whose privileges should be revoked.

Example:
REVOKE INSERT
ON students
FROM john;

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Managing Privileges:
--Assign Permissions: Use GRANT to ensure users have the necessary privileges to perform their tasks, such as reading data (SELECT) or modifying it (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).

--Limit Access: Use REVOKE to restrict access, ensuring users can no longer perform unauthorized operations.

--Delegating Permissions: Use the WITH GRANT OPTION in the GRANT command to allow a user to further delegate their granted privileges to other users.

Example:
GRANT SELECT
ON students
TO john WITH GRANT OPTION;


--evoking All Privileges: Use REVOKE ALL to completely remove all privileges from a user.

Example:
REVOKE ALL
ON students
FROM john;
