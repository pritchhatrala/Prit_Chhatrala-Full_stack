1. What is a view in SQL, and how is it different from a table?
Ans:-
---View in SQL:
--A view in SQL is a virtual table that consists of a stored query that selects data from one or more tables. It doesn't store data physically but provides a way to represent complex queries as if they were a table. A view simplifies querying by abstracting the complexity of the underlying data structure.


--View:
CREATE VIEW EmployeeDetails AS
SELECT employee_name, department_id
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 50000;
