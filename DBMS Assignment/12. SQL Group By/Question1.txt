1. What is the GROUP BY clause in SQL? How is it used with aggregate functions?
Ans:-
--The GROUP BY clause in SQL is used to group rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows. It is often used with aggregate functions (such as COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN) to perform calculations on each group of rows.

--How is it Used with Aggregate Functions
--The GROUP BY clause organizes data into groups based on one or more columns, allowing aggregate functions to calculate results for each group.

Syntax:
SELECT column_name, aggregate_function(column_name)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column_name;
