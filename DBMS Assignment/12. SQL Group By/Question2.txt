2. Explain the difference between GROUP BY and ORDER BY.
Ans:-
---Summary of GROUP BY vs ORDER BY---

1. GROUP BY:
--Groups rows with the same values into summary rows.
--Used with aggregate functions like SUM, COUNT, etc.
--Produces one result per group.

--Example: GROUP BY category groups data by category.

2. ORDER BY:
--Sorts rows in ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) order.
--Does not group rows; simply arranges them.

--Example: ORDER BY quantity DESC sorts rows by quantity in descending order.
